# When did this project start?
This project started on the **15th of April** by **Blitoff** and **I**, and was completed on the **23rd of April**

## What were the goals for this project?
Having never worked with pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, we were looking for a small project to work together in and develop ourselves in those languages.

## Why a calculator?
In the meantime I started going through **Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller**'s Udemy course on Javascript, where we work on a rather simple calculator. That's where the idea came from. Seemed simple enough!

At first, it was based off of **Maximilian's 'Unconventional Calculator'**. It had an input, and 4 buttons: +, -, x, /. 
It was a great starting point, as it allowed us to get more comfortable working with DOM and try things out on a relaxed environment. However, we were soon wanting more of the calculator! Thus, we decided to start from the beginning and build a more conventional calculator!
